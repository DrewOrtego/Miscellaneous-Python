# Miscellaneous-Python/Text-Based-Game-Engine/gameObjects

**Demonstrates**
* Extensive use of custom classes and inheritance
* Use of Python's decorator feature
* Use of dict to store instaniated objects, similar to JSON

    
**Purpose:**
     
      Stores all the objects instantiated when playing a new, or previous, game.
      The player is always located in a room, which contains object, and the game
      needs a way to keep track of where these objects are located at all times
      (in case the player wants to save their game). These modules make that
      easy by providing an interface to each and every in-game object and the
      various attributes of that object which are manipulated throughout the game.
