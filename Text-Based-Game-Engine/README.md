## Python 3.4 Text Based Game Engine
<br>
**This project is currently in development again!**
<br>
Coming soon:
<br>
1. More robust save/load feature.
<br>
2. Zork-like interface with room names and number of moves.
<br>
3. New demo!
<br>
Look for updates soon!
<br>
<br>
**Description:**<br>
The engine to a Zork-like text game-- written entirely in Python 3 (use **3.4!**)
This particular version contains a simple demonstration of how to implement rooms, items, and simple commands into the game. There is also a "demo mode" in this code which you will be prompted to activate upon running the code. Try it, it's fun.
<br>
<br>
**To Run:**<br>
Simply run "main.py" in any interactive interpreter. (Be sure to use Python **3.4!**)
<br>
<br>
**Just a Heads Up:**<br>
This is still a work in progress, but should be complete soon. I'm always looking for writers who are interested in exploring what this type of interface can offer for story-telling, so please feel free to reach out to me if you're interestd in collaborating.
<br>
<br>
**One Other Thing:**<br>
If you enjoy this type of thing, and would like to play more games like it, Google "Zork" and look for the free online version of that amazing game. This game is based entirely off of Zork's interface, though it is still lacking a lot of Zork's robustness.
