# Miscellaneous-Python/Text-Based-Game-Engine/userInterface

**Demonstrates**
* Use of organized, formatted text output to the game console
* Text-interface which provides useful, unobstructed information
* User interface which aims to compartmentalize game-use instructions

**Purpose:**

    Provides a means to format the output of the game in a way that will
    resize the output to any given console, and print the proper headers
    for giving the user concise, clear information at all times.
    The help menu provides a useful in-game set of instructions without
    interrupting the flow the game. The player can jump in and out of the
    help menu anytime, without worrying that the new interface will
    change anything about their current state in the game.
