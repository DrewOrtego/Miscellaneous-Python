Web-Scraping
============
Collects all the images from http://www.facets.la/wallpapers/ on a folder. Requires Python 2 and the Beautiful Soup module found here: http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download

~~**Note:** the facet.la site appears to be down now.~~
<br><br>
**Update:** It looks like the site has been replaced with facets.la (note the "s") so this script should work again! Yay!
<br>
